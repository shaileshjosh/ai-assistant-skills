# Prerequisites

Install either:

## Flutter

```bash
flutter --version
```

## FVM

```bash
fvm --version
```

The bootstrap script automatically prefers FVM and falls back to Flutter.

---

# Download Bootstrap Script

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaileshjosh/ai-assistant-skills/main/flutter/bootstrap/create_flutter_project.sh
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x create_flutter_project.sh
```

---

# Create Cursor Project

```bash
./create_flutter_project.sh banking_app cursor
```

Open:

```bash
cd banking_app
cursor .
```

---

# Create Claude Project

```bash
./create_flutter_project.sh banking_app claude
```

Open:

```bash
cd banking_app
claude
```

# Developer Workflow

## Step 1

Initialize the project:

```text
Initialize this project
```

The AI automatically:

* Loads project-bootstrap
* Loads architecture
* Creates the project foundation

---

## Step 2

Create a feature:

```text
Create Customer feature
```

The AI automatically:

* Creates domain layer
* Creates data layer
* Creates presentation layer
* Creates providers
* Creates routing
* Creates tests when required

---

## Step 3

Create authentication:

```text
Create Login feature
```

The AI automatically applies:

* architecture
* auth-standards
* data-storage
* unit-testing

---

## Step 4

Add caching:

```text
Add caching to Customer feature
```

The AI automatically applies:

* caching

---

## Step 5

Generate tests:

```text
Generate tests for Customer feature
```

The AI automatically applies:

* unit-testing

---

## Step 6

Review code:

```text
Review current branch changes
```

The AI automatically applies:

* flutter-pr-review

---

# Example Prompts

```text
Initialize this project

Create Login feature

Create Customer feature

Create Dashboard feature

Add caching to Customer feature

Generate tests for Customer feature

Review current branch changes
```

---

# Architecture

The architecture specification is defined in:

```text
skills/architecture/SKILL.md
```

This is the source of truth for:

* Clean Architecture
* Feature First Structure
* Dependency Rules
* Riverpod
* GoRouter
* Dio
* Hive
* Secure Storage
* Testing Standards

All generated code must follow this specification.

---

# Project Priorities

1. Security
2. Scalability
3. Clean Architecture
4. Testability
5. Maintainability

All skills and generated code must follow these priorities.
